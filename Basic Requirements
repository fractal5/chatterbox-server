Basic Requirements

- Continue to use bower to install (and keep track of) all the client-side libraries you use as you work through this sprint.
- Use npm to install (and keep track of) all the server-side libraries you use as you work through this sprint.
- Learn how to use Node to start an HTTP server and how to connect to that server with a web browser. (Source code for a bare-bones HTTP server is included in the file `server/basic-server.js`.)
- Learn how to use export and require. Write a proper request handling function in the file `server/request-handler.js`. Use export to make this function available, and use require to import the function into `server/basic-server.js` and use it there.
- Make your Node server implement the URLs you used for your chat client (eg `/classes/messages`).
- Modify your chat-client code to connect to your Node server instead of connecting to Parse. (http://127.0.0.1:3000/ instead of https://api.parse.com/1/). Start the server and try out the client!
- Make all the Mocha tests pass.
- To run Mocha tests for your Node server, you must run npm npm install.
- Run the tests using npm test from the main directory.
- The tests in server/spec/ServerSpec.js expect the handleRequest function in server/request-handler.js to be defined.
